# AP-ASSIGNMENT-1
I have created a command line application called as CoWin which is targeted towards the management of Hospital, People's Log, Vaccines &amp; Vaccination Process.

The application has two chief stakeholders, citizens and hospitals. First, the hospitals will register themselves on the portal and upload their slots, which the
citizens can avail themselves of. The COWIN portal has details of citizens, hospitals and vaccines available on the portal. Vaccine information such as the 
name of the vaccine, the number of doses, and the gap between the doses has been added to the COWIN portal before the hospitals can add slots for these vaccines.

The principles of INHERITANCE of Classes and appropriate Data Structures for the functioning have been used, along with other concepts of Object Oriented Programming 
in JAVA.

The output is menu based and the code performs the following 7 functions:
1) Add Vaccine
2) Register Hospital
3) Register Citizen
4) Create Slots
5) Book a Slot
6) Slots Available in Hospital
7) Check Vaccination Status
